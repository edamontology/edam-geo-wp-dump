- remove all rdf:datatype except boolean
- add lang=de where de.wikipedia (and similar)--looks like WebProtégé ignores, but keeps it if untouched👍🏽
- maybe move saved-by up?
- ideally also remove edamontology: nonsense namespace
- xxxMatch properties need to be removed or changed to proper
- maybe strip of all non-EDAM (and non-legacy) properties?--could maybe auto-export afterwards as an inflated format with a lot of stuff, up-to-date (incl. WikiData etc.), too?💡
